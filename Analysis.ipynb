    "## The Common Swift\n",
    "\n",
    "The common swift (_Apus apus_), is a medium-sized bird resembling the barn swallow and house martin but larger, belonging to the order Apodiformes. These resemblances result from convergent evolution, as their closest relatives are New World hummingbirds and Southeast Asian treeswifts. Its scientific name \"Apus\" is derived from Latin, meaning swift, reflecting the ancient belief that swifts had no feet. Swifts have short legs used for clinging to vertical surfaces, and they avoid settling on the ground to minimize vulnerability, with non-breeding individuals often in continuous flight for up to ten months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taxonomy and Physiology\n",
    "\n",
    "The common swift, was classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 as _Hirundo apus_ and later categorized under the _genus Apus_ by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1777. Its name \"apus\" is derived from the Latin word for swift, reflecting the belief that these birds were footless swallows. These birds measure 16–17 cm in length with a wingspan of 38–40 cm. They are primarily blackish-brown, with a small white or pale grey chin patch that is not easily visible from a distance.\n",

    "### Language Behavior\n",
    "Common swifts are known for their distinctive loud screaming calls, often forming groups during summer evenings. These gatherings may serve various purposes, including ascending to sleep in flight, with radar tracking revealing flocking behavior during specific times, possibly for social interaction or information exchange. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Motivations\n",
    "As the name would led you to believe, the Common Swift is a fairly popular recorded species, specifically in the Xenocanto bird dataset there are thousands of high quality recordings that can be obtained through a wrapped API (see _example_download.py_) therefore this is a good starter specie to test if Zipf's law is present after some preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this work will be to explore a novel way to synthetize bird sounds into a codified language and thus allowing possible languange analysis in the future."
